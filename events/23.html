  </figcaption>
</figure></action-text-attachment><br><br>We have a brand new event that'll give you guys one last chance to pull ahead of the pack. If you don't live under a rock, you know how this game show works. Contestants pick a briefcase as their own, then choose others to eliminate them in their pursuit to reach the big prize of a million dollars. Here is specifically how our version will work:Â <br><br>
</div>
<ul>
<li>There are <strong>20 briefcases </strong>that have point values of<strong> 0.01 to 200. </strong>This means that you can earn up to <strong>200 points</strong>. This also means you can earn <strong>0.01 points</strong>.</li>
<li>Your cabin will pick a briefcase at the beginning. This will be your briefcase. If you eliminate all other briefcases and are down to the final two, you will be able to open your briefcase or switch with the last remaining briefcase.</li>
<li>Your cabin will then choose cases to open throughout the day. This will be finalized by your counselor or a cabin member your counselor has allowed to submit actions. Once a certain amount of cases are opened, your cabin will be offered a deal based on the points remaining in the non-opened cases along with dealer's own input. You may choose to take the deal if you are content with it, or you may choose no deal. You will then be forced to go through another round of opening cases before being offered a deal again. Rinse and repeat until your cabin either takes a deal or we are down to the last two cases.</li>
<li>The amount of cases that need to be opened before a deal is offered are as follows: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1.</li>
<li>Along with an <strong>all day game</strong>, there will also be <strong>ONE live game</strong> per cabin that you will need to schedule. The game works the same, except it'll be quicker due to the fact it will take place in voice call. Multiple of your cabin members can show up and give input as needed. Additionally, the point values for the live game will go from <strong>0.01 to 100</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>The all day game will start at 10:00 AM EST.</strong></li>
</ul>
<div>
<br>That's right. That means every cabin will have 2 chances to earn up to a total of <strong>300 points</strong> each. Have fun y'all I know we will!!!</div>
