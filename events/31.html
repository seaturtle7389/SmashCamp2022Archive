</figure></action-text-attachment><br><br>Smash Camp 2014. One of the most legendary Smash Camp events ever, The Mario Kart 8 tournament, was held. With 36 entrants, it was an absolute logistical nightmare, and I have actually no idea what those in charge of camp were thinking when they held it. But everyone who participated LOVED IT, and it was my favorite event that year. I have been searching all these years since for a way to reclaim that magic but in a more palatable way that didn't ensue in mass panic and chaos. After 8 straight years of R&amp;D, we've found a way to do it again.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>How is the tournament going to be run? We are going to run 12 races with 12 players in the lobby, once at a set time. This means each cabin gets to send three campers to the big race. Race will take place either on Day 3 (Wednesday) or Day 4 (Thursday) at 7 PM EDT. Why are we holding it in one go and restricting the players? We discovered back in 2014 that getting so many people (8-12) to agree on a time to play is very difficult, and getting more than one group to do it just compounds the difficulty of the scheduling. Mario Kart 8 2014 barely got across the finish line, and we're running the event this way to make sure we finish it with fuel to spare. We're very sorry to those that wanted to play but won't end up being able to because of the 3 player limit, and we're also sorry to those who won't be able to race because the timing doesn't work for them. We wanted to pick a time late enough that some of those in PDT are done with their responsibilities for the day and early enough so that folks in European timezones don't have to stay up past usual gamer hours. If you're in Australia or another timezone, sorry and we promise we love you too.</div>

<h4>Rules</h4>
<div class="card my-2">
  <div class="card-body">
  <span class="font-weight-bold">In game settings:</span>
  <ul>
    <li>150cc Race
    </li>
<li>No Teams
    </li>
<li>Normal Items
    </li>
<li>No COM
    </li>
<li>Four Races (12 total but we keep this setting low just in case the lobby breaks)
    </li>
<li>Three Members per Cabin
  </li>
</ul>
<br>
  <span class="font-weight-bold">Stage Selection:</span> Random ONLY, if you pick a stage and the game chooses it, you forfeit 5 points from your team for the event.<br>
  <span class="font-weight-bold">Disconnections:</span> Some people are going to disconnect at points throughout the tournament, but the show must go on. If you disconnect, you should report it to the staff immediately who will take note of it. If we have one disconnect, the race result will stand, and the lobby will be reset so that the disconnected can rejoin. If we have two or more disconnects, we will scratch that race's result and will run another race, up to 4 redos. If we have enough issues that we are having to redo more than 4 races (I don't even know how this could happen) we will just take the points from the completed races.<br>
  <span class="font-weight-bold">Substitutions:</span> If one of a cabin's representatives has internet or other related issues mid-event, we will allow them to substitute someone else from their cabin in.<br>
  </div>
</div>
<h4>Scoring</h4>
</div>
<div>Every cabin's TOTAL points will be tallied at the end of the 12 races, and scoring is based on the team with the most points.<br><br>
</div>
<div class="advanced-code-block">
<span class="font-weight-bold first">1<sup>st</sup> place</span> will be awarded <span class="font-weight-bold">200 points</span><br>
<span class="font-weight-bold second">2<sup>nd</sup> place</span> will be awarded <span class="font-weight-bold">150 points</span><br>
<span class="font-weight-bold third">3<sup>rd</sup> place</span> will be awarded <span class="font-weight-bold">100 points</span><br>
<span class="font-weight-bold">4<sup>th</sup> place</span> will be awarded <span class="font-weight-bold">50 points</span><br>
</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Sign-ups will be done in cabins, as everything has to be handled as precisely as possible to ensure we can get the most out of this event that we can. Please talk to your cabin leader and provide your availability on Day 3 and 4 to them as well.</div>
